# Joining Cal Webring

Cal Webring is open to current UC Berkeley students, alumni, and faculty with a personal website/portfolio.

## How to join

1. Fork this repo.
2. Open `members.ts` and add yourself to the end of the `members` array. Grad students and faculty: put your program/department and status (e.g. 'PhD, 2028' or 'Faculty') instead of an undergrad year

```ts
   {
      name: "Your Name",
      url: "https://your-site.example.com",
      year: "2030",
      major: "Computer Science",
   },
```

3. Copy this snippet into the homepage of your site, replacing `YOUR_URL_HERE` with the same URL you used in step 2:

```html
   <div style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 12px; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;">
      <a href="https://calwebring.com/prev?current=YOUR_URL_HERE">←</a>
      <a href="https://calwebring.com">
         <img src="https://calwebring.com/badge.png" width="36" />
      </a>
      <a href="https://calwebring.com/next?current=YOUR_URL_HERE">→</a>
   </div>
```
4. Open a pull request. Include a link to your live site in the PR description so it can be checked before merging.

## Guidelines

- Your site should be something you actually maintain — no dead links or permanently "under construction" pages.
- Keep the badge visible somewhere on your site so the ring stays connected.
